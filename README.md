# RAGHack: Let's build RAG applications together

<img width="1599" alt="RAG AI Hack Banner (6)" src="media\RAG AI Hack Banner.png">

üõ†Ô∏è Build, innovate, and #Hacktogether! üõ†Ô∏è
It's time to start building AI applications using the power of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). ü§ñ + üìö = üî•

Large language models are powerful language generators, but they don't know everything about the world. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) combines the power of large language models with the knowledge of a search engine. This allows you to ask questions of your own data, and get answers that are relevant to the context of your question.

RAGHack is your opportunity to get deep into RAG and start building RAG yourself.  Across 25+ live streams, we'll show you how to build RAG apps on top of Azure AI in multiple languages (Python, Java, JS, C#) with multiple retrievers (AI Search, PostgreSQL, Azure SQL, Cosmos DB), with your own data sources! You'll learn about the most popular frameworks, like LangChain and Semantic Kernel, plus the latest technology, like agents and vision models. The possibilities are endless for what you can create... plus you can submit your hack for a chance to win exciting prizes! ü•≥

The hackathon starts on **September 3rd** and ends on **September 13th**. Join us!

## Register

Register for the hackthon on the [Reactor series page](https://reactor.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/series/s-1369/). That will register you for both the streams and the hackathon.
